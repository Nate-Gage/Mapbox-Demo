# VAISALA - MAPBOX DEMO - NATE GAGE

## Overview

This application was built in React Typescript, Node.js, and Docker. 

This application uses the Mapbox API to display temperatures for a group of cities from a simple JSON file. The user has the ability to switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius which sends a flag in the request to convert the temperature on the backend. 

To start the Express server, run 'npm start' from /api. To run Create React App, run 'npm start' from /client.
